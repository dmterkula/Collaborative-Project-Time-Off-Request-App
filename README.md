# Collaborative-Project-Time-Off-Request-App

This is the repository of the Database branch of the collaborative project.
This is the portion of the out of office time tracker and time-off request application that I worked on and that I am familar with.
The user interface and services layer had their own branches and work, but I did very little work in those areas, so the contents
of this repo are best representive of the work I have done

I wrote all of the tests for this portion of the project and also helped write the domain objects and the DAL layer.
